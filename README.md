Testing on Java

-Propouse:

This is going to be a simple game developed in Java11, with the propuse of implemeting on the future a Neural network able to play the game.

-Game description:

The game consist on a ship and a circuit delimited by hexagon-tiles, the objective is to complete the circuit without touching any wall.

-Stage:

	-Ship smooth movement with aceleration a deceleration implemented.
	-Implemented Screen Bounds with AABB collision.
	-Builded the framework to handle the game objects.
	
  
-TODO:

	-Finish the OBB collision projections and implement it to the hexagon
	-Create algorithm to fill the screen with tiles object.
	-Create the other game elemts, (menu, points, timer, etc).
